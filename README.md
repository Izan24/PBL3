BChef is a visual aplication ...

## Project description

There are many problems in the culinary world, one of the most notable being the lack
of knowledge when it comes to cooking. That is why, using Java, VHDL, and network
infrastructure features, a kitchen assistant has been created. This will use a Java-based
application, as well as enable voice communication. Along with this, a relationship has been
established with a database, which will store information required by the application, through
Web services. Likewise, the desktop application will be able to interact with an FPGA using the
UART protocol, to simulate a home automation kitchen. The implementation of this project has
brought new perspectives on the technologies used, in addition to allowing the acquisition of
new knowledge and the strengthening of those already obtained previously.
